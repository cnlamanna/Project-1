This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of music genre popularity in Texas in 2022, identify the most influential artists within each genre during this period, and examine how demographics, including age, gender, impact the distribution of music preferences.

#####Objective 1: Determining the Three Most Popular Music Genres
By analyzing various sources, including music sales, streaming data, and charts, this project will identify and rank the three most popular music genres in 2022. The analysis will consider factors such as album sales, digital downloads, streaming statistics, and overall audience engagement to establish the genres that have resonated the most with listeners during this period.

#####Objective 2: Identifying Artists with the Most Significant Impact on Each Genre
Building upon the identified popular genres, this project will delve into the artists who have exerted the most significant influence within each genre. By examining various factors such as album sales, critical acclaim, streaming numbers, and cultural impact, we will identify and highlight the artists who have shaped and defined these genres during the specified time frame.

#####Objective 3: Investigating the Effects of Demographics on Music Distribution
This project will explore how demographics, including age, gender, impact the distribution and popularity of different music genres. By leveraging available data, such as music streaming platforms, we will analyze the listening preferences of various demographic groups. We will examine which genres are more favored by different demographics, such as age groups (e.g., 16-20 years), genders, and regions.

###Expected Outcome:
This project will result in a comprehensive analysis report that outlines the three most popular music genres of 2022, highlights the artists who have significantly influenced each genre, and examines the impact of demographics on music distribution.
